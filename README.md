## Game

Install the requirements

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game 

```sh
python3 ./run_game.py
```

## Server

Honestly it's easiest to just start the docker compose :)

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

For development just install the additional server requirements

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

Run the server

```sh
python3 ./run_server.py
```
